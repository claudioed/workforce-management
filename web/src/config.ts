/**
 * Runtime endpoint resolution for workforce_mfe.
 *
 * This remote is deployed as one image that must work in more than one
 * environment, so the API location cannot be a build-time constant. The
 * console shell publishes `window.__WAREHOUSE_CONFIG__` from a runtime
 * /config.json before any remote mounts; this module turns that origin into
 * this context's own API base.
 *
 * The fleet's localhost topology puts APIs on a DIFFERENT origin from the
 * frontend (Kong on :8000, Nginx on :80), so this is a real cross-origin URL
 * rather than a same-origin path -- Kong carries the matching CORS policy.
 *
 * In a production build a missing/malformed origin throws rather than falling
 * back to a developer port: a silent fallback would mean a deployed console
 * quietly talking to nothing.
