# Architecture

The service is **hexagonal / ports-and-adapters**, with one non-negotiable
dependency rule:

> **domain depends on nothing; application depends on domain; adapters depend
> on application and domain.**

No framework type and no SQL type appears anywhere in `internal/domain`.

## The rule is executable, not aspirational

`internal/architecture/architecture_test.go` encodes the dependency rule as
real Go tests using [arch-go](https://github.com/arch-go/arch-go), and CI runs
them as a blocking `arch-test` job. The tests assert that:

- `internal/domain/...` imports nothing else from this module;
- `internal/application/...` imports only `internal/domain/...`;
- inbound and outbound adapters never import each other;
- only `cmd/` is allowed to wire everything together.

A layering violation therefore fails the build rather than surviving as a code
review comment. See [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-arch-go-architecture-fitness-tests.md).

## The eight use cases

| Use case | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `StartAssociateShift` | Opens a roster entry with initial certifications |
| `CertifyAssociate` | Adds one certification to an existing roster entry |
| `ProposePathPlan` | Advisory computation: `heads = ceil(charge ÷ rate)`, using the caller's rate or a measured one from `labor-performance`, optionally trimmed by observed idle share. Persists nothing |
| `CommitShiftPlan` | Validates the headcount split (including the live installed-capacity ceiling from `fulfillment-execution`) and commits it; publishes `ShiftPlanCommitted` |
| `AssignLabor` | Puts an associate on a path, closing any prior active assignment |
| `StartBreak` / `EndBreak` | Opens and closes a logged break |
| `GetStaffingGap` | Read model: planned heads versus active assignments for a path, plus observed idle share when available |
| `EndAssociateShift` | Closes active assignments, then the shift |

`ProposePathPlan` is deliberately the odd one out: it touches no repository at
all, because a proposal is advisory. The software proposes; a human commits.
(It may read measured rates and idle share from `labor-performance`, but it
writes nothing.)

## Quality gates

These run in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; unless noted, on every push and pull request:

| Gate | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Lint | `golangci-lint` (errcheck, govet, staticcheck, unused, ineffassign, bodyclose, misspell, unconvert, gocritic) |
| Unit tests + race | `go test ./... -race`, coverage ≥ 90% on domain + application |
| Integration | build-tagged tests against a live Postgres 16 service container, plus testcontainers-backed outbox and Kafka-consumer tests |
| Architecture fitness | `arch-go` via `internal/architecture` |
| BDD acceptance | `godog` over the real chi router |
| OpenAPI + AsyncAPI lint | Spectral, against `apis/*.yaml` |
| Helm chart lint | `ct lint` — pull requests into `main` only |
| Mutation testing | `gremlins` — weekly and on manual dispatch, never blocking PRs |
| Drift | `deadcode`, `go mod tidy -diff`, `knip` on `web/` — weekly and on manual dispatch |
| Generated API docs | `docs-api-drift` regenerates `docs/docs/api-reference/rest` and fails on a diff |
| Vulnerabilities / image | `govulncheck`; Trivy image scan (pull requests into `main` only) |
