# 0014. Installed-capacity ceiling, sourced from fulfillment-execution

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

`CommitShiftPlan` has always enforced `plannedHeads <= installedStations`
per path line — but `installedStations` is a number the CALLER supplies
in the request body. This context has no dependency on
fulfillment-execution (the bounded context that actually owns the
Station registry), so it has never had any way to verify that number
against physical reality. A caller supplying a stale or simply wrong
`installedStations` could commit a plan that either overcommits real
capacity or unnecessarily rejects a plan that would fit.

fulfillment-execution's own ADR-0018 closes exactly this gap from the
other side: it exposes `GET /capacity/{capability}`, a read-only
projection over its Station registry reporting how many stations are
physically registered with a given capability, live. This ADR is the
consuming half of that decision.

## Decision

**`CommitShiftPlan` fetches a LIVE installed-capacity ceiling from
fulfillment-execution for every line, and `shiftplan.CommitShiftPlan`
enforces it as a SECOND, INDEPENDENT check — never a replacement for the
existing caller-supplied `installedStations` invariant.** Both checks
must pass:

```go
// internal/domain/shiftplan/shift_plan.go
func CommitShiftPlan(buildingId, shiftId string, lines []PathPlan,
	installedStations map[shared.PathId]int, // caller-supplied, structural
	installedCapacity map[shared.PathId]int, // LIVE, fulfillment-execution-sourced
	maxHoursPerShift float64, at time.Time) (*ShiftPlan, error) {
	for _, line := range lines {
		if line.PlannedHeads > installedStations[line.PathId] {
			return nil, ErrPlannedHeadsExceedInstalled
		}
		// A missing entry defaults to a live capacity of 0 -- never
		// skipped -- so a caller cannot bypass this check by omitting
		// a path.
		if line.PlannedHeads > installedCapacity[line.PathId] {
			return nil, ErrExceedsInstalledCapacity
		}
		...
	}
}
```

We rejected collapsing these into one check (replacing
`installedStations` outright with the live fetch) because the two numbers
answer genuinely different questions and existing BDD fixtures /
`shiftplan` tests already depend on `installedStations` as a distinct,
structural input the caller is asserting. Keeping both as independent
checks means a caller-side lie ("I say there are 20 stations") is caught
by the structural check even before a network call, and a stale live
fetch is caught by the physical check even when the caller's number
looked plausible.

### Fail LOUD, not fail open — the key difference from `MeasuredRateClient`

This service already has one precedent for consulting an external
Supplier from inside a use case: `ProposePathPlan`'s
`MeasuredRateClient` (ADR-0012), which fails OPEN — on any error it
silently falls back to the caller-supplied `plannedRate`, because a
measured rate is a soft, optional enrichment to a mere PROPOSAL.

`InstalledCapacityClient` does the opposite:

```go
// internal/application/ports/ports.go
type InstalledCapacityClient interface {
	InstalledCapacity(ctx context.Context, pathId shared.PathId) (int, error)
}
var ErrInstalledCapacityUnavailable = errors.New("installed capacity unavailable")
```

```go
// internal/application/usecases/commit_shift_plan.go
func (uc *CommitShiftPlan) Execute(ctx context.Context, buildingId, shiftId string,
	lines []shiftplan.PathPlan, installedStations map[shared.PathId]int) (*shiftplan.ShiftPlan, error) {
	installedCapacity := make(map[shared.PathId]int, len(lines))
	for _, line := range lines {
		capacity, err := uc.InstalledCapacity.InstalledCapacity(ctx, line.PathId)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err // FAILS THE ENTIRE COMMIT — no fallback
		}
		installedCapacity[line.PathId] = capacity
	}
	...
}
```

`ErrInstalledCapacityUnavailable` on ANY line fails the whole commit.
There is no fallback path, because `CommitShiftPlan` mutates real state
(it commits a plan and publishes `ShiftPlanCommitted`), and this fleet's
own standing rule — already applied identically in order-management's
fail-loud `inventorystorage` client — is to fail loud for anything that
mutates real state. A soft proposal can afford to guess; a commit cannot.

### Adapters, mirroring `laborperformance`'s shape

```go
// internal/adapters/outbound/fulfillmentexecution/client.go
type Client struct{ baseURL string; doer HTTPDoer }
func (c *Client) InstalledCapacity(ctx context.Context, pathId shared.PathId) (int, error) {
	// GET {baseURL}/capacity/{pathId} -- pathId's own lowercase string
	// form is used VERBATIM as the capability. Unlike labor-performance's
	// uppercase TaskType mapping (taskTypeForPathId), no translation
	// table is needed: fulfillment-execution's Station capabilities and
	// this repo's PathId already share the same lowercase convention
	// (e.g. "pick", "pack").
}
```

```go
// internal/adapters/outbound/fulfillmentexecution/permissive.go
type PermissiveClient struct{}
func (PermissiveClient) InstalledCapacity(_ context.Context, _ shared.PathId) (int, error) {
	return 0, ports.ErrInstalledCapacityUnavailable
}
```

Selected at boot via `INSTALLED_CAPACITY_MODE` (`http`|`permissive`,
default `permissive`) and `FULFILLMENT_EXECUTION_BASE_URL`, the same
env-selected-adapter pattern `LABOR_PERFORMANCE_MODE` already uses. The
default is deliberately the FAIL-LOUD permissive client, not a silent
no-op: an operator who forgets to set `INSTALLED_CAPACITY_MODE=http`
gets every `CommitShiftPlan` call rejected loudly (logged as a `Warn` at
boot with an explicit hint), never a quiet capacity check that always
passes.

## Consequences

### Easier

- A shift-plan commit can no longer silently overcommit past
  fulfillment-execution's REAL Station registry — the exact class of gap
  this fleet's Amazon Process Path Model review flagged.
- The two checks (`installedStations`, `installedCapacity`) stay legible
  independently: a test or an operator reading a rejection knows
  immediately which one failed (`ErrPlannedHeadsExceedInstalled` vs
  `ErrExceedsInstalledCapacity`).

### Harder

- `CommitShiftPlan` now has a REQUIRED runtime dependency on
  fulfillment-execution being reachable — a new failure mode this
  context did not previously have. This is a deliberate tradeoff, not an
  oversight: the alternative (silently trusting a caller-supplied number)
  is the exact bug this ADR closes.
- One extra network round-trip per distinct path in a commit (deduped —
  a plan with two lines for the same path fetches once, not twice).

## Verification

`internal/domain/shiftplan/shift_plan_test.go`: 4 new tests
(`TestCommitShiftPlan_RejectsPlanExceedingInstalledCapacity`,
`_AllowsPlannedHeadsExactlyEqualToInstalledCapacity`,
`_MissingInstalledCapacityEntryDefaultsToZeroCeiling`, plus every
existing test updated for the new parameter) — `make mutation` (the
CI-gated fast subset, `./internal/domain/shiftplan`) and `make
mutation-full` (the exhaustive `./internal/domain` run) both pass at
100.00% efficacy / 100.00% mutator coverage, unchanged from before this
feature.

`internal/application/usecases/usecases_test.go`: 3 new tests
(`TestCommitShiftPlan_RejectsPlanExceedingLiveInstalledCapacity`,
`_FailsLoudWhenInstalledCapacityUnavailable`,
`_FetchesInstalledCapacityOncePerDistinctPath`) plus 7 existing
`CommitShiftPlan`-dependent tests updated across the application, HTTP,
MCP, and outbound-kafka test suites.

`internal/adapters/outbound/fulfillmentexecution/`: `client_test.go` (6
tests: published-contract shape, verbatim lowercase PathId-as-capability,
zero-is-a-real-answer, every failure mode maps to
`ErrInstalledCapacityUnavailable`, unreachable-server) and
`permissive_test.go` (1 test).

`go test ./... -race` (all packages, including `internal/architecture`'s
hexagonal fitness tests), `golangci-lint run ./...` (0 issues),
`go build -tags=integration ./...` / `go vet -tags=integration ./...`
(caught and fixed two stale `shiftplan.CommitShiftPlan` call sites this
signature change broke under the separate `integration` build tag — the
same pitfall class this fleet has hit before), a real Postgres
integration test (`TestShiftPlanRepo_*`, run against a live local
Postgres via `-tags=integration`) proving the persistence layer is
unaffected, and `cd docs && npm run build` all pass.
