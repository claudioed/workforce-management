# Ecosystem

`workforce-management` is one of the Go bounded-context services in the
`warehouse-systems` platform. Each has its own model, its own database and its
own deployment.

## The one-paragraph version

This service **publishes** `ShiftPlanCommitted` to
`warehouse.workforce.events`, one message per `PathPlan` line. One sibling
consumes it: `wes-work-planning`, which projects it into a read model called
`LaborPlanObserved`, keyed by `path_id`.

It also **reads from** three siblings, each edge selected by an env var: the
live installed capacity from `fulfillment-execution` on every
`CommitShiftPlan`, measured rates and idle share from `labor-performance`, and
optionally the process-path catalogue from `process-path-management`'s topic.
[Integration](./integration.md) lists every edge.

With `fulfillment-execution` it shares only that capacity read. No task,
claim, or associate identity crosses between them, which is a design decision
rather than a gap. See [the path boundary](../business-context/path-boundary.md).
