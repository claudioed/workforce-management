# Project: Workforce Management (Supporting Bounded Context)

Owns "who is on shift, on which process path, at what rate; direct vs
indirect hours." Covers the **shift-start planning horizon** (a human commits
a headcount split across paths) plus **intra-shift assignment tracking**
(moving people between paths as backlogs deviate — the move itself is a human
call; this context makes the gap legible, it does not decide). It stops at
the **path boundary**: it never links an associate to a specific task —
individual task dispatch belongs to `fulfillment-execution`. Full narrative
docs (business context, DDD canvases, generated API reference) live at
<https://claudioed.github.io/workforce-management/> and in [`docs/`](docs/).

Source of truth for the domain model: `/Users/claudioed/docs/amazon-fulfillment-ddd.md`
and `/Users/claudioed/warehouse-systems-ddd.md`. Honor that ubiquitous language.

## Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters. Strict dependency rule: **domain depends on
nothing; application depends on domain; adapters depend on application/domain.**
No framework or SQL types in the domain layer. Enforced by an arch-go fitness
test (ADR-0007, `make arch-test`).

Deep-dive references, split out so this file stays a short index:

- **rules/domain-model.md** — ubiquitous language, aggregates & invariants,
  domain events, use cases, REST API surface.
- **rules/integrations.md** — outbound HTTP clients (measured rate, installed
  capacity), the process-path catalogue, Kafka events + transactional outbox,
  CORS.
- **rules/analytics-and-observability.md** — the analytics data product
  (ADR-0010), the MCP inbound adapter (ADR-0008), OTel traces/metrics/logs.
- **rules/frontend.md** — the `web/` micro-frontend remote.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Run the OLTP service (Postgres required)
docker compose up -d
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://workforce:***@localhost:5432/workforce?sslmode=disable"
go run ./cmd/workforce                # :8080, applies migrations on boot

# Fast pre-commit loop (no DB needed, ~1 min)
make check        # fmt-check, vet, build, lint, test (-race)

# Before pushing
make check-all    # check + coverage gate (90%) + arch-test + bdd

# Other gates
make vuln         # govulncheck — run after touching go.mod/go.sum
make mutation     # fast gremlins subset on internal/domain/shiftplan (blocks CI)
make mutation-full   # exhaustive gremlins over internal/domain (scheduled)
make integration  # needs Postgres/DATABASE_URL; outbox tests use testcontainers

# Docs site (Docusaurus, generates REST reference from apis/openapi.yaml)
cd docs && npm ci && npm run gen-api-docs -- all && npm run build
```

`make help` lists every target; each mirrors a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` job
so local feedback matches CI. `lefthook install` wires `make check`/lint into
git hooks (pre-commit/pre-push) — optional, run `make check` proactively
regardless since hooks are per-clone.

## Code Standards

- Go 1.26, modules. Module path: `github.com/claudioed/workforce-management`.
- chi (`go-chi/chi/v5`), pgx/v5 + pgxpool, golang-migrate SQL migrations.
- Config via env (`DATABASE_URL`, `HTTP_ADDR`, see README.md's full env
  table for every service/adapter mode variable).
- Typed domain errors mapped to HTTP status + RFC 7807 `application/problem+json`
  in the adapter (ADR-0005) — never a bespoke error shape.
- JSON DTOs live in the http adapter; never leak domain structs directly.
- gofmt/go vet clean; every package has a doc comment.

## Testing

- Table-driven tests: domain + application (in-memory adapters); one
  `httptest` case per endpoint; build-tagged Postgres integration tests
  (`-tags=integration`, skipped without `DATABASE_URL`; outbox tests boot
  their own Postgres via testcontainers).
- BDD/acceptance: `features/*.feature` (Gherkin) run via godog against the
  real HTTP surface wired to in-memory adapters (`go test ./... -run
  TestFeatures -v`, ADR-0006). One feature file per invariant area:
  shift_plan, labor_assignment, breaks, staffing_gap.
- Mutation testing (gremlins, `.gremlins.yaml`): fast subset on
  `internal/domain/shiftplan` blocks CI; the full `internal/domain` run is
  scheduled, not blocking.
- Coverage gate: 90% over `internal/domain/...,internal/application/...`.

## Definition of Done

- `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...` (and `-race`) all green;
  gofmt clean.
- README.md updated: run steps, endpoints w/ curl examples, layering note,
  and the "stops at the path boundary" rationale if touched.
- Each of these four invariants has a dedicated failing-path test at domain
  + use-case + HTTP layers: `plannedHeads > installedStations` rejected on
  `ShiftPlan` commit; double-booking (second ACTIVE assignment for the same
  associate) rejected; assignment without required certification rejected;
  assignment while on an active break rejected.
- If `apis/openapi.yaml` changed, regenerate the docs site reference pages:
  `cd docs && npm run gen-api-docs -- all` and commit the result — see
  `docs/package.json`'s `gen-api-docs` script. `apis/asyncapi.yaml` has no
  generated pages today; its narrative counterpart is
  `docs/docs/ecosystem/integration.md` — update both together.
