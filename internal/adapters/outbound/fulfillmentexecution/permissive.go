// Every call returns ports.ErrInstalledCapacityUnavailable, which
// CommitShiftPlan surfaces as a FAILED commit -- unlike
// labor-performance's PermissiveClient (which fails open because a
// measured rate is a soft, optional enrichment to a proposal), this
// fails loudly because an installed-capacity ceiling gates a commit that
// mutates real state, and this fleet's own rule is to fail loud for
// anything that mutates real state. A caller must explicitly opt into
// INSTALLED_CAPACITY_MODE=http to ever commit a shift plan in this
// service's default configuration.
