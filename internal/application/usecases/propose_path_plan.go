// DefaultIdleShareTrimThreshold is the idle share above which ProposePathPlan

// ProposePathPlan is constructed with IdleShareTrimThreshold <= 0 (the zero
// value), so a caller that omits it entirely -- every existing test, and any
// composition root that doesn't read IDLE_SHARE_TRIM_THRESHOLD -- still gets
// this sensible default rather than an accidental 0% threshold that would
// trim on any nonzero idle share.

// ProposePathPlan is a pure computation: heads needed to cover a path's
// charge at a planned rate. It persists nothing — a human must still
// commit the plan via CommitShiftPlan.
//
// plannedRate is now OPTIONAL: a caller passing <= 0 (not supplied) gets a
// real measured rate fed back from labor-performance via MeasuredRate
// (feature: close-the-loop measured rate, ADR-0012) when one is available
// for this path's task type. This is a SOFT enrichment, not a mutation of
// real state: any failure to obtain a measured rate — labor-performance
// unreachable, no TaskType mapping for this path, or genuinely no data
// yet — falls through to the existing zero-rate behavior (0 proposed
// heads) rather than failing the request. A caller-supplied plannedRate
// always wins outright; MeasuredRate is never consulted when one is given.
//
// Independently of the rate source, a high observed IDLE SHARE for this
// path's task type (idleness-as-staffing-signal) trims the proposed
// heads: associates already spending a large share of clocked time idle
// signal that fewer additional heads are needed to clear the same
// charge. This applies whether resolvedRate came from the caller or from
// MeasuredRate. FAIL-OPEN by the same discipline as MeasuredRate: no
// IdleShare wired, or ErrIdleShareUnavailable (no TaskType mapping, or no
// idle observation yet), applies NO trim -- the pre-existing heads
// computation is the safe default.
