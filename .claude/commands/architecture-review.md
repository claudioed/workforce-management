Perform a bounded-context boundary and ADR-compliance review of the
current changes (or `$ARGUMENTS` if given, e.g. a branch/PR diff range).

This is EXPENSIVE relative to `/code-review` — it reasons about
cross-repo/cross-context implications, not just this diff's local
correctness. Use it post-integration (before merging a PR that touches
architecture, not on every small commit) or when asked explicitly to
check a design decision against this fleet's standing architecture.

## What to check, in priority order

1. **Hexagonal dependency direction.** Domain depends on nothing;
   application depends on domain+ports; adapters depend on
   application+domain; only `cmd/` wires every layer together. Run
   `go test ./internal/architecture/... -v` first — if it's already red,
   report that and stop; don't hand-review what a fitness test already
   caught.
2. **Customer/Supplier direction, per `.claude/rules/bounded-context-boundary.md`
   (or this repo's equivalent doc).** A new outbound call to a sibling
   context must go the direction ADRs already established — check
   `docs/docs/adr/` for the relevant context-mapping ADR before assuming
   a new integration is fine. Flag any outbound call added to a context
   this repo doesn't already integrate with; that's a new architectural
   decision that needs its own ADR, not a code change slipped in
   silently.
3. **MCP additive-boundary rule (ADR-0008 fleet-wide).** A change under
   `internal/adapters/inbound/mcp/` must depend only on
   application/domain, and nothing else in the codebase may depend on
   it. If this repo has a `TestMCPAdapterDependencyRule` fitness test,
   confirm it's green; if not, check by eye.
2b. **Zero-write guardrails, where applicable.** If this repo has a
   documented zero-write constraint (e.g. warehouse-ops-agent v1), check
   no mutating HTTP method or MCP tool without `ReadOnlyHint: true` was
   added to an outbound/inbound surface bound by that constraint.
4. **Analytics isolation (ADR-0006-style, where this repo has an
   `internal/analytics/` read side).** The OLTP domain/application layers
   must never import the analytics store or read model; the analytics
   side must depend on nothing internal except itself. This is a real,
   already-fitness-tested rule in most repos — confirm the test exists
   and is green rather than re-deriving it by eye if possible.
5. **Kafka consumer-group pattern correctness.** A new Kafka consumer
   must use either (a) a named long-lived constant for a genuinely
   single-instance consumer, or (b) a per-process-unique generated group
   id for an event-sourced local-cache consumer that replays full
   history on every start. Flag any new consumer whose pattern doesn't
   match its actual replay behavior — this is a correctness bug, not a
   style issue (see this repo's `.claude/skills/how-to-add-an-integration-event.md`
   for the two patterns and the incident that taught this fleet the
   difference).
6. **A new bounded-context integration with no companion documentation.**
   If this change introduces or changes a cross-repo contract (a new
   REST call, a new Kafka topic subscription, a new MCP tool consumed by
   a sibling), check whether an ADR documents the decision — and whether
   a companion ADR should exist in the OTHER repo too, per this fleet's
   companion-ADR convention (see `.claude/skills/how-to-write-an-adr.md`).
7. **Auth-reintroduction and sibling-call bans**, same as `/code-review`
   items 6-8, but reasoned about more thoroughly here — check not just
   "is there a Bearer literal" but "does this change's INTENT require
   re-litigating the fleet-wide auth-removal decision," which would need
   its own ADR, not a silent code change.

## Output format

State clearly: PASS (no architectural concerns), CONCERNS (list them,
each tied to the specific rule/ADR it would violate), or NEEDS-ADR (the
change is architecturally sound but undocumented — name what the ADR
should cover). Cite the specific file/rule/ADR for every finding; a
finding with no citation is not actionable.

This is advisory. It never blocks a merge on its own, and it never
modifies files. If a finding conflicts with a decision explicitly stated
in this repo's own AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, defer to that document and say
so — this command reasons about the fleet's general conventions, not a
higher authority than the repo's own explicit guidance.
